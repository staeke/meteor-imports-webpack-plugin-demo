<p>
  Great! This page is to demo a setup where:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The client is built using webpack</li>
  <li>The server runs as a normal meteor app (but not the client parts)</li>
  <li>You can run the full app as a normal Meteor app inside <code>meteor-app</code>. There are some risks involved with this, so see the <code>README.md</code> file</li>
  <li>images and media are served using fallback routes in webpack-dev-server to meteor-app/public. To build them using webpack, use the <code>HtmlPlugin</code></li>
  <li>Twitter bootstrap is used as a Meteor package for demo purposes. NOTE: These types of packages are really recommended to include outside of Meteor packages</li>
  <li>Various scripts can be found in <code>package.json</code></li>
</ul>
